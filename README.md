# Drupal base theme

Things to do:
 - Good readme file ( :-D )
 - Docs folder which describes how to use theme. We need a really good documentation here.
 - Sub-module, move theme.php to the submodule's service. 
 - Drush/Drupal console commands to generate preprocesses.
 - Availability to manage not only preprocesses.
 - Better plugin system
 - ???
